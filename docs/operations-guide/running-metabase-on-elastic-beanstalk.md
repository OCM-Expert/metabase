## Running Metabase on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This guide is comprised of two sections: one with a quick and simple way of launching Metabase for testing purposes only, and a second one with a more comprehensive guide so you can deploy Metabase with production-level capabilities.

### Quick and simple

1) Download [this Elastic Beanstalk deployment](https://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.metabase.com/{{ site.latest_version }}/metabase-aws-eb.zip) file which has the zipped configuration to run Metabase in Elastic Beanstalk.
2) Click on this [pre-set link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=us-east-1#/newApplication?applicationName=Metabase&platform=Docker%20running%20on%2064bit%20Amazon%20Linux%202&environmentType=SingleInstance&tierName=WebServer&instanceType=t3a.small&withVpc=true&withRds=false) that will provide you with a few configurations already set and will launch Metabase in the US East region. On the bottom of the page, click on "Upload your code" and click on the "Choose file" button to upload the file that you downloaded in the previous step. Then click on "Review and Launch"
3) Go to the Network section, click "Edit", select the default VPC (if you haven't created any VPC in AWS, then it's the only one that should be available in the combobox), enable "Public IP Address", select one "Availability zone" in Instance Subnet and click "Save".
4) Click on "Create App" and wait a few minutes till Metabase launches, you will be able to access your test Metabase instance in the link that appears in the top of the page under the name of the environment.

**Note**: this environment is for testing purposes only and it will lose all data once it reboots as it does not have an application database connected where Metabase can persist its data. If you want to connect an application database to this simple deployment, check out [how to create an RDS database](creating-RDS-database-on-AWS.html) and connect it later to this environment via [environment variables](environment-variables.html).

### Comprehensive guide

This guide tends to be for advanced users, **so proceed with caution** and only if you know what you are doing.

In the following guide we will build a highly-available and production ready Metabase deployment, which will include:
a) Public (internet facing) and Private subnets, with route tables to isolate the traffic.
b) Internet Gateway.
c) Security groups (firewall rules).
d) NAT Gateways (so instances in Private subnets can fetch updates without being exposed).
e) Application Load balancer (so you can deploy SSL/TLS with custom certificates and even Web Application Firewall rules).
f) A production-grade relational database so Metabase can persist all settings, questions, dashboards, etc.

If you would like a reliable, scalable and fully managed Metabase, please consider [Metabase Cloud](https://www.metabase.com/start/hosted/) as all these steps are already taken care for you.

## Step 1 - Create the network

### 1.1 Creating a VPC

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network you can use to isolate resources. Inside these VPC's, you can create subnets, firewall rules, route tables and many more. It's one of the foundational features of AWS, and you can learn more about it [here](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/).

To create a VPC, go to the VPC service in AWS and click on the VPC label and then on the "Create VPC" button on the top right section of the page. Use the following values:

- Name: Metabase-network
- IPv4 CIDR: 192.168.0.0/21 (here you can use any IP range that fits your network design, in this specific example we will need 6 subnets)

### 1.2 Creating subnets

We're going to create 6 subnets: two for the load balancer, two for the Metabase application itself and the rest for the database. This will allow your application to be highly available and only fail if these 2 zones or the whole AWS region goes down.

To create subnets, go to the Subnets section and click on the button "Create Subnet" on the top right side of the page.

On the page that opens, select the VPC ID of the VPC you created in the previous step and create 6 subnets:

- Public-AZ1: IP CIDR block of 192.168.1.0/24, availability zone 1a
- Public-AZ2: IP CIDR block of 192.168.2.0/24, availability zone 1b
- Application-AZ1: IP CIDR block of 192.168.3.0/24, availability zone 1a
- Application-AZ2: IP CIDR block of 192.168.4.0/24, availability zone 1b
- Database-AZ1: IP CIDR block of 192.168.5.0/24, availability zone 1a
- Database-AZ2: IP CIDR block of 192.168.6.0/24, availability zone 1b

Please consider that we used subnets in the IP range that we selected in the previous step, in case you have selected another IP range, then consider switching the subnet ranges.

### 1.3 Creating an Internet Gateway

In this step we're going to create the Internet Gateway for the application to be accesible over the Internet.

On the VPC section go to "Internet Gateways", and create a new Internet Gateway. After the creation is ready, right click on your new Internet Gateway and click on "Attach to VPC" and then select the VPC that you created in the first step of this guide.

### 1.4 Creating a NAT Gateway

This is a component that the network needs to pull the containers and updates to the Operating System. To create a NAT Gateway, click on NAT Gateway in the VPC menu and click on the button located in the top right section. Complete it with the following parameters:

- Subnet: select the subnate named Public-AZ1. The NAT gateway will be located only in one subnet, which means that if that specific Availability zone goes down, you lose the internet connectivity on your private subnets (so instances won't be able to fetch updates during the downtime of the AZ).
- Elastic IP allocation ID: click on "Allocate Elastic-IP" to generate a fixed IPv4 address for the NAT gateway.

Then click on Create NAT Gateway on the bottom of the page.

### 1.5 Create route tables

This step is one of the most important steps of this guide, as it will limit the routing of the entire network so you can rest assured that your deployment traffic is isolated.

Go to "Route Tables" in the VPC menu and then click on "Create route table" button which is located in the top right corner. You'll need to create 3 route tables (one for each tier of your deployment). Assign them all to the VPC you created in the first step of the guide:

1) public
2) application
3) database

For the "public" route:

- your-vpc-ip-range/21 -> target: local
- 0.0.0.0/0 -> target: the **internet gateway** that you created on step 1.3 of this guide

For the "application" route:

- your-vpc-ip-range/21 -> target: local
- 0.0.0.0/0 -> target: the **NAT gateway** that you created on step 4 of this guide

For the "database" route:

- your-vpc-ip-range/21 -> target: local

After the creation of the route tables you need to assign each route table to the subnets you created in step 2 of this guide, so public route table needs to be explicitly associated with Public-AZ1 and Public-AZ2, application needs to be associated with Application-AZ1 and Application-AZ2, and finally database associated with Database-AZ1 and Database-AZ2.

If you forget to explicitly associate a subnet with a route table, then the subnets will inherit the route table of the VPC, which could have unintended consequences.

### 1.6 Create the security groups (firewall rules)

In the VPC menu, click on "Security groups" in the right side of the page under "Security" header and create the following Security Groups (make sure you select the correct VPC):

Public (this will be the security group for the Load Balancer):

- Inbound rules: HTTP and HTTPS for Any IP source both IPv4 and IPv6 (or use the IP addresses of the places you want to access Metabase)
- Outbound rules: Custom TCP on port 3000. For the destination, use the IP ranges of the Application subnet (in our example we used 192.168.3.0/24 and 192.168.4.0/24)

Application (this will be the security group for the Metabase Application):

- Inbound rules: Custom TCP on port 3000. For the source, use the IP ranges of the Public subnet (in our example we used 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24)
- Outbound rules: Custom TCP on port 5432 or 3306 (depending if you're going to use PostgreSQL or MySQL as the application database). For the destination, use the IP ranges of the database subnet (in our example we used 192.168.5.0/24 and 192.168.6.0/24).

Database (this will be the security group for the Database):

- Inbound rules: Custom TCP on port 5432 or 3306 (depending if you're going to use PostgreSQL or MySQL as the application database). For the source, use the IP ranges of the Application subnet (192.168.3.0/24 and 192.168.4.0/24 in this guide).
- Outbound rules: None.

## Step 2 - Create the database

### 2.1 Create a subnet group

To make the database live in a private subnet, we need to create a Subnet group. So go to RDS-> Subnet groups -> Create DB subnet group

- Name: Metabase RDS subnet group
- Description: Metabase RDS subnet group
- VPC: select the VPC you created in the previous step
- Availability zone: use the availability zones you used in the previous step (1a and 1b)
- Subnets: select the subnets you created specifically for the database (the ones ending in 5.0/24 and 6.0/24)

Then click on the Create button and head to the Databases sectio to create the cluster

### 2.2 Encrypt traffic to the database

By default, RDS does not enable encryption in transit, so in order to make the traffic encrypted to the database, go to "Parameter groups", create a new parameter group selecting the the database and version that you're going to use (e.g. `postgres14`), use a group name to identify the new parameter group (e.g. `postgres14-encrypted`), then search for the `rds.force_ssl` parameter in the new parameter group and set it to 1.

### 2.3 Create the RDS database

On the Database section click on Create database and use the following values:

- Engine type: choose between MySQL, PostgreSQL or Aurora (both MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible will work). We'll continue with PostgreSQL in this guide.
- Version: latest one available, if possible
- Templates: Production
- Availability and Durability: Multi-AZ DB Instance
- DB instance identifier: any name you wish. In this case we'll use metabase-app-db
- Master username: postgres
- Master password: choose any secure password and repeate it in the confirmation box
- DB instance class: db.m6g.large is a good starting point for production workloads. If you're only looking to spin up a small server, you can use burstable instances (t class).
- Storage type: Provisioned IOPS SSD, although gp2 disks can be selected depending on the amount of users and usage pattern of the instance.
- Allocated storage: 100GB is a good starting point for production workloads
- Storage autoscaling: leave it enabled with the 1000 GB storage value
- VPC: ensure you're using the VPC created in the previous section and that the subnet group is the one you created in step 2.1
- Public access: No
- VPC security groups: remove "default" and add "Database" (which was created in step 1.6)
- Database authentication: Password authentication

#### Additional configuration

- Initial database name: metabase
- Log export: select PostgreSQL log

Once finished, click on the create button on the bottom of the page and wait till the database finishes creating. This step can take a long time to finish as it's spinning up an Active-Passive DB cluster for high-availability.

## Step 3 - Create the Elastic Beanstalk deployment

Go to Elastic Beanstalk in AWS now to finish the creation of your deployment and click on "Create Application"

### Application information

Elastic Beanstalk is organized into Applications and Environments, so to get started we need to create a new application. You can customize the application name in case you need other than the default one.

![Elastic Beanstalk Application Information](images/EBApplicationInformation.png)

### Environment information

Here's where you can pick the environment name and the domain URL that you want to use for your Metabase instance. The environment name is simply the label you're assigning to this instance of Metabase.

As for the domain URL, Feel free to get creative — just remember that the URL for your Metabase instance must be unique across all AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployments, so you'll have to pick something that nobody else is already using. We often recommend something like `mycompanyname-metabase`. If you don't care about the URL you can simply leave it to whatever Amazon inputs by default. Just be aware that this can't be changed later.

![Elastic Beanstalk Environment Information](images/EBNewEnvironmentInformation.png)

### Platform

While most of the fields here will be correctly pre-filled by following the launch URL above, you'll just need to do two things:

1. Make sure **Platform** is set to `Docker`, with the platform branch dropdown set to `Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2`, and Platform version to the one that has a `(Recommended)` tag.
2. Change the **Application code** setting to `Upload your code`.

![Elastic Beanstalk Base Configuration](images/EBUploadYourCode.png)

- In the **Source code origin** section click the `Choose file` button with the `Local File` radio button selected and upload the file you dowloaded at the very beginning of this guide (`metabase-aws-eb.zip`):

![Elastic Beanstalk Base Configuration](images/EBUploadZipFile.png)

These settings will run the Metabase application using the [official Metabase Docker image on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/metabase/metabase/).

After the file finished uploading, click on "Configure more options" and use the following values:

- Presets: use "Custom configuration"

#### Software

- Container options: ensure that Proxy server is set to "None".
- S3 log storage: enable the log rotation.
- Instance log streaming to Cloudwatch Logs: enable Log Streaming and adjust the retention to your needs.
- Environment properties: you need to use environment variables to



## Quick Launch

Download the [Metabase Community Edition AWS source bundle file](https://downloads.metabase.com/{{ site.latest_version }}/metabase-aws-eb.zip) to upload to Elastic Beanstalk.

Metabase provides several pre-configured Elastic Beanstalk launch URLs to help you get started. Open one of the links below in a new tab to create an Elastic Beanstalk deployment with a few choices pre-filled. Then just follow the step-by-step instructions below to complete your installation.

After clicking any launch URL, you should see a screen that looks like this:

![Elastic Beanstalk First Screen](images/EBFirstScreen.png)

### Step 1 - Creating the Application

#### Application information

Elastic Beanstalk is organized into Applications and Environments, so to get started we need to create a new application. You can customize the application name in case you need other than the default one.

![Elastic Beanstalk Application Information](images/EBApplicationInformation.png)

#### Environment information

Here's where you can pick the environment name and the domain URL that you want to use for your Metabase instance. The environment name is simply the label you're assigning to this instance of Metabase.

We often recommend something like `mycompanyname-metabase`. If you don't care about the URL you can simply leave it to whatever Amazon inputs by default. Just be aware that this can't be changed later.

![Elastic Beanstalk Environment Information](images/EBNewEnvironmentInformation.png)

#### Platform

While most of the fields here will be correctly pre-filled by following the launch URL above, you'll just need to do two things:

1. Make sure **Platform** is set to `Docker`, with the platform branch dropdown set to `Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2`, and Platform version to the one that has a `(Recommended)` tag.
2. Change the **Application code** setting to `Upload your code`.

![Elastic Beanstalk Base Configuration](images/EBUploadYourCode.png)

- In the **Source code origin** section click the `Choose file` button with the `Local File` radio button selected and upload the file you dowloaded at the very beginning of this guide (`metabase-aws-eb.zip`):

![Elastic Beanstalk Base Configuration](images/EBUploadZipFile.png)

These settings will run the Metabase application using the [official Metabase Docker image on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/metabase/metabase/).

Click **Review and launch**.  You'll be directed to a page to configure and launch your instance.

### Step 2 - Configure the basic Metabase architecture

#### 2.1 Enabling VPC

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network you can use to isolate resources. Inside these VPC's, you can create subnets, firewall rules, route tables and many more. It's one of the foundational features of AWS, and you can learn more about it [here](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/).

You must configure your Application launch in a VPC, otherwise you'll receive an error when creating it as AWS no longer supports launching instances outside VPC's. To use a VPC, head to the **Network** section in the configuration and click on the `Edit` button.

![Elastic Beanstalk Network section](images/EBNetworkSection.png)

Once inside the Network configuration, you need to select the VPC where the Application will exist. If you haven't created a VPC, then AWS creates a `default` VPC per region that you can use.

You need to select **at least** 2 zones where the Load Balancer (we will configure this component in the next step) will balance the traffic, and  **at least** 1 zone where the instance will exist. For the load balancer to send traffic to a living instance, there has to be a zone in common.

![Elastic Beanstalk Networking configuration](images/EBNetworkingConfig.png)

After configuring the zones for both the load balancer and the application, click **Save** at the bottom of the page.

#### 2.2 Enabling enhanced health checks

To set up your load balancer, you'll need to enable enhanced health checks for your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

Click on the `Edit` link under the Load Balancer section as seen here:

![Elastic Beanstalk Monitoring](images/EBLoadBalancerEdit.png)

Select `Application Load Balancer` in the ***Load Balancer type*** if not already selected.

In the **Processes** section, select the default process and click on `Actions` → Edit.

![Elastic Beanstalk Monitoring Process](images/EBProcessesSection.png)

The **Health check path** is where the Load balancer asks the application if its healthy so it can send traffic to. Set this path to `/api/health`

![Elastic Beanstalk Monitoring endpoint](images/EBProcessEditEndpointHealth.png)

After configuring this health check you can click on `Save` at the bottom of the page.

#### 2.3 Final step and deploy

Now go to the Capacity section and click **Edit**.

![Elastic Beanstalk Networking configuration](images/EBCapacity.png)

The only change you need to do here is to reduce the number of Instances from 4 (the default number) to 1, as we still haven't created a centralized database where Metabase will save all of its configurations and will be using only the embedded H2 database which lives **inside** the Metabase container and [is *not recommended* for production workloads](configuring-application-database.html) as there will be no way to backup and maintain that database. **When your instance is restarted for any reason you'll lose all your Metabase data**. If you are just doing a quick trial of Metabase that may be okay but otherwise you would like to start [creating your database engine in RDS separately](creating-RDS-database-on-AWS.html) or deploy one a separate server. You can take a look at the [Metabase at Scale](https://www.metabase.com/learn/data-diet/analytics/metabase-at-scale.html) article we wrote about how you can build highly-available and scalable Metabase architectures.

![Elastic Beanstalk Networking configuration](images/EBCapacityModified.png)

Now click on `Save` at the bottom of the page and you can now click on `Create App` at the end of the Configuration page to start creating the environment.

### Step 3 - Wait for your environment to start

This can take a little while depending on AWS. It’s not uncommon to see this take 10-15 minutes, so feel free to do something else and come back to check on it. What's happening here is each part of the environment is being provisioned with AWS's infrastructure automation functionality named CloudFormation (so you can see the detailed progress for the creation of your environment if you open CloudFormation in another tab).

When it's all done you should see something like this:

![ebcomplete](images/EBComplete.png)

To see your new Metabase instance, go now to EC2 on the top bar, and once there look for "Load Balancers" in the left menu and open the link of the Load Balancer which is located next to "DNS Name".

Now that you’ve installed Metabase, it’s time to [set it up and connect it to your database](../setting-up-metabase.md).

## Optional extras

There are many ways to customize your Elastic Beanstalk deployment, but commonly modified settings include:

### Instance Details

- `Instance type` (`Instances` block) is for picking the size of AWS instance you want to run. We recommend **at least** `t3a.small` for most uses. You can always [scale](https://www.metabase.com/learn/data-diet/analytics/metabase-at-scale.html) vertically by changing this configuration.
- `EC2 key pair` (`Security` block) is only needed if you want to SSH into your instance directly which is **not recommended**.

### Application Database creation inside Elastic Beanstalk configuration (not recommended)

When you hit the `Create App` button, AWS Elastic Beanstalk creates a CloudFormation template.  This template means that the database will be created with the Elastic Beanstalk stack, and removed when you remove the application.

If you want to use a production-grade database based on best practices to persist all Metabase configurations you have to [create one in RDS separately](creating-RDS-database-on-AWS.html) or manage your own on a separate server and then connect the Elastic Beanstalk instance/s with the RDS database through [environment variables](#set-or-change-environment-variables).

If you want to continue on this path and you know what you are doing, then: look for the **Database** configuration pane as below. and click on the `Edit` button.

![Elastic Beanstalk Database Configuration Options](images/EBDatabaseConfigurationOptions.png)

The database settings screen will give you a number of options for your application database. Regarding individual settings, we recommend:

- `Snapshot` should be left as `None`.
- `Engine` should be set to `postgres`. Metabase also supports MySQL/Maria DB as backing databases, but **only** on a separate running RDS connected via [environment variables](#set-or-change-environment-variables). Trying to follow these steps and selecting MySQL will result in an error.
- `Engine version` can simply be left on the default, which should be the latest version.
- For `Instance class` you can choose any size, but we recommend `db.t2.small` or larger for production installs. Metabase is pretty efficient so there is no need to make this a big instance.
- You can safely leave `Storage` to the default size.
- Pick a `Username` and `Password` for your database. We suggest you hold onto these credentials in a password manager, as they can be useful for things like backups or troubleshooting. These settings will be automatically made available to your Metabase instance.
- You can safely leave the `Retention setting` as `Create snapshot`.
- Under `Availability` we recommend the default value of `Low (one AZ)` for most circumstances.

![Elastic Beanstalk Database Settings](images/EBDatabaseSettings.png)

Once you've entered a password and clicked `Save`, a message will appear saying that an RDS database should have at least 2 Avalability Zones selected, so you will have to go again to the Network options and select at least 2 Availability Zones for the Database. We recommend using the same Availability Zone as where the instance resides since you will be charged for cross-zone traffic otherwise.

### Permissions

If this is your first time creating an application for Elastic Beanstalk then you will be prompted to create a new IAM role for your launched application. We recommend simply leaving these choices to their defaults.

![ebpermissions](images/EBPermissions.png)

When you click `Next` a new tab will open in your browser and you will be prompted to create a new IAM role for use with Elastic Beanstalk. Again, just accept the defaults and click `Allow` at the bottom of the page.

![ebiamrole](images/EBIAMRole.png)

### Set or change environment variables

In order to configure environment variables for your Elastic Beanstalk deployment (e.g., [to connect the deployment to a separate RDS database](creating-RDS-database-on-AWS.html)), click on your Metabase environment in Elastic Beanstak, go to Configuration → Software, and look for the Environment Properties in the bottom.

In the Environment Properties section, you'll be able to set or change the variables for [configuring your Metabase deployment](https://metabase.com/docs/latest/operations-guide/environment-variables.html).

![EB Environment Variables](images/EBEnvVariables.png)

### Notifications

For a simple way to keep tabs on your application, enter an email address  in the **Notifications** block to get notifications about your deployment and any changes to your application.

## Deploying New Versions of Metabase on Elastic Beanstalk

Upgrading to the next version of Metabase is a very simple process where you will grab the latest published Elastic Beanstalk deployment file from Metabase and upload it to your `Application Versions` listing. From there it's a couple clicks and you're upgraded.

Here's each step:

- Go to Elastic Beanstalk and select your `Metabase` application.
- Click on `Application Versions` on the left nav (you can also choose `Application Versions` from the dropdown at the top of the page).
- Download the latest Metabase Elastic Beanstalk deployment file:
  - [https://downloads.metabase.com/{{ site.latest_version }}/metabase-aws-eb.zip](https://downloads.metabase.com/{{ site.latest_version }}/metabase-aws-eb.zip)
- Upload a new Application Version:
  - Click the `Upload` button on the upper right side of the listing.
  - Give the new version a name, ideally including the Metabase version number (e.g. {{ site.latest_version }}).
  - Select `Choose File` and navigate to the file you just downloaded.
  - Click the `Upload` button to upload the file.
  - After the upload completes make sure you see your new version in the Application Versions listing.
- Deploy the new Version:
  - Click the checkbox next to the version you wish to deploy.
  - Click the `Deploy` button in the upper right side of the page.
  - Select the Environment you wish to deploy the version to using the dropdown list.
  - Click the `Deploy` button to begin the deployment.
  - Wait until all deployment activities are completed, then verify the deployment by accessing the Metabase application URL.

Once a new version is deployed, you can safely delete the old Application Version. We recommend keeping at least one previous version available for a while in case you want to revert for any reason.
